# Interests
I use machine learning techniques to simulate dynamics of quantum and classical systems in high dimensions. 

# Coding Projects
- Symmetrizing Neural Quantum States (NQS) algorithm, preserving lattice symmetries, spin inversion, mirror, and total spin conservation symmetries
  in a way that is efficient both in computational time and memory.
  - [arXiv:2407.20065](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20065)
- Implimenting an SU(2) spin rotational symmetry for the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. 
- Implementing exact diagonalization (ED) algorithm for 2-dimensional quantum systems, preserving lattice symmetries, spin inversion, mirror, and total spin conservation symmetries.
